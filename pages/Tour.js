              Havelock(Swaraj) has well-justified 
              fame for being a wonderland for travelers.
              Laze around on its secluded beaches, or
              explore its dense and serene mangroves; 
              swim among exotic corals while you indulge 
              in Scuba Diving or go out there and explore 
              the wilderness on long Jungle Treks â€“ Havelock has it all!
              </p>
              <p>
              As Havelock is rich in scenic beauty and harbours 
              one of the best dive sites in all of Andaman,
               we recommend staying here for at least two nights. 
               The tourist season falls between October and May, 
               which is also the rush season as the weathers are 
               favourable and mainland holiday seasons overlap 
               during this period. Most of the activities at 
               Havelock are based outdoors, like scuba diving, 
               kayaking and snorkelling.
